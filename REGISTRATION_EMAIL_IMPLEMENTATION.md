### Email Flow

```
User Registration â†’ OTP Verification â†’ Registration Complete â†’ Confirmation Email Sent
     â†“
Landing Page Interest â†’ Interest Captured â†’ Confirmation Email Sent
     â†“
Super Admin Approval â†’ Admin Account Created â†’ Credentials Email Sent
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
SMPT_SERVICE=gmail
SMPT_MAIL=your-email@gmail.com
SMPT_PASSWORD=your-app-password
SMPT_PORT=465
SMPT_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
```

### SMTP Settings

- **Service**: Gmail (configurable)
- **Port**: 465 (SSL)
- **Authentication**: Required
- **TLS**: Enabled

## Testing

### Test Script

A test script `test-email.js` has been created to verify email functionality:

```bash
node test-email.js
```

### Test Cases

1. Basic email functionality
2. Registration confirmation email
3. Error handling for failed emails

## Error Handling

### Email Failures

- Registration process continues even if email fails
- Errors are logged to console
- No impact on user experience

### Fallback Scenarios

- If `FRONTEND_URL` is not set, defaults to `https://yourdomain.com`
- Graceful degradation for missing email configuration

## Customization

### Email Content

- Templates can be easily modified in the respective controller functions
- HTML and CSS are inline for maximum email client compatibility
- Branding elements can be updated in the template strings

### Timing

- Registration confirmation: Immediate
- Credentials email: When super admin approves
- Team contact: Within 24 hours (manual process)

### User Experience Improvements

- **Success Notice**: Shows for 1 minute (60 seconds) with clear instructions to check email
- **Error Notices**: Show for 8 seconds to give users time to read and act
- **Clear Messaging**: Users are informed to check their email for confirmation and next steps
- **Visual Feedback**: Success message includes checkmark emoji for better visual confirmation

## Security Considerations

### Password Handling

- Generated passwords are sent via email
- Users are instructed to change passwords after first login
- No password storage in email logs

### Email Validation

- Emails are sent to verified email addresses only
- OTP verification required before registration completion

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. Email templates stored in separate files
2. Email queue system for high-volume scenarios
3. Email tracking and analytics
4. Multi-language support
5. A/B testing for email content

### Monitoring

- Email delivery success rates
- User engagement with email content
- Conversion tracking from email to login

## Support

### Troubleshooting

1. Check SMTP configuration in `config/config.env`
2. Verify email credentials are correct

4. Use test script to verify functionality

## Conclusion

The registration email system provides a professional, automated communication flow that:

- Improves user experience
- Reduces support inquiries

- Sets clear expectations for next steps

All emails are designed to be mobile-responsive and compatible with major email clients.
